Project Description
The project, whimsically named "pluck pluck," is a desktop application designed to provide humorous, real-time feedback on a person's exercise form. It uses computer vision to track movements and plays funny movie dialogues when the form is incorrect or when the person is inactive.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world of over-optimized fitness trackers, we saw a glaring gap: a lack of unnecessary, judgmental digital coaches. We've solved the problem of having to rely on self-motivation by creating an app that actively teases you for bad form.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
"pluck pluck" is a desktop app that uses machine learning to detect squats and hand raises. Instead of offering helpful advice, it critiques your form in a playful and passive-aggressive manner with movie dialogues. It's the fitness coach you didn't know you needed, and probably don't.

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

Languages used: Python

Frameworks used: CustomTkinter (GUI), Mediapipe (Pose Estimation)

Libraries used: OpenCV, Pydub, NumPy, Pillow

Tools used: FFmpeg (for audio playback)

For Hardware:

List main components: Laptop with an integrated or external webcam.

List specifications: A modern laptop with a good processor and at least 8GB of RAM is recommended for smooth real-time video processing.

List tools required: Git for version control.

Implementation
For Software:

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/J0o00/USELESSPROJECT.git





Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3.12 -m venv useless-project-env
.\useless-project-env\Scripts\activate





Install the required libraries:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe pydub customtkinter Pillow





Download and set up FFmpeg:

pydub requires FFmpeg to play audio. Download the executables and add the bin folder to your system's PATH. You can get the latest builds from here.

Download and place the audio and GIF files:

Due to GitHub's size limitations, the audio and GIF files are not included in this repository.

Download the audio files from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CRWFIQakxHDFg6jeqSOUMj7ZJQZpFr70?usp=drive_link

Download the GIF file from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bnv5SWeGrKLKLX86VkiJe7Hgj9BaS0cZ/view?usp=drive_link

Create a folder named audio in your project directory.

Inside the audio folder, create two subfolders: incorrect_form and standing_still.

Place the corresponding .mp3 audio clips in these folders.

Place the duck.gif file in the main project directory.

Run
With your virtual environment active, run the Python script:

python "Useless Exercise Form Detector.py"
